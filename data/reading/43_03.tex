\subsection{Analyse}

\begin{blk}
    \begin{qst}
        Q8. According to paragraph 4, Alexander’s empire was characterized by all of the following EXCEPT
    \end{qst}

    \begin{chc}
        A. decreased need for military control

        B. growing professionalism

        C. growth of cities

        D. specialization in trades
    \end{chc}

    \begin{psgq}
        This implied that the city-state was based on the idea that citizens were not specialists but had multiple interests and talents—each a so-called jack-of-all-trades who could engage in many areas of life and politics. It implied a respect for the wholeness of life and a consequent dislike of specialization. It implied economic and military self-sufficiency. \textbf{But} with the development of trade and commerce in Alexander’s empire came \textbf{the growth of cities}\textsuperscript{C}; it was \textbf{no longer possible to be a jack-of-all-trades}\textsuperscript{D}. \textbf{One now had to specialize, and with specialization came professionalism.}\textsuperscript{B} There were getting to be too many persons to know; an easily observable community of interests was being replaced by a multiplicity of interests. The city-state was simply too “small-time.”
