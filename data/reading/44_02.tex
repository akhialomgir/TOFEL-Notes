        Q9. According to paragraph 3, Hockney believes that all of the following indicate use of a camera obscura EXCEPT
    \end{qst}

    \begin{chc}
        A. very detailed, realistic work

        B. increased contrast between light and dark

        C. oversimplification of forms when the image is traced

        D. complicated foreshortening of objects
    \end{chc}

    \begin{psgq}
        In recent times the British artist David Hockney has published his investigations into the secret use of the camera obscura, claiming that for up to 400 years, many of Western art’s great masters probably used the device to produce \textbf{almost photographically realistic details}\textsubscript{A} in their paintings. He includes in this group Caravaggio, Hans Holbein, Leonardo da Vinci, Diego Velázquez, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Agnolo Bronzino, and Jan van Eyck. From an artist’s point of view, Hockney observed that a camera obscura \textbf{compresses the complicated forms of a three-dimensional scene into two-dimensional shapes that can easily be traced}\textsubscript{C} and also \textbf{increases the contrast between light and dark}\textsubscript{B}, leading to the chiaroscuroartistic term for a contrast between light and dark effect seen in many of these paintings. In Jan van Eyck’s The Marriage of Giovanni Arnolfini and Giovanna Cenami, the \textbf{complicated foreshortening}\textsubscript{D} a technique for representing an image in art that makes it appear to recede in space in the chandelier and the intricate detail in the bride’s garments are among the clues that Hockney thinks point to the use of the camera obscura.
