    \begin{qst}
        Q3.According to paragraph 2, which of the following principles of ecosystems can be learned by studying a pond?
    \end{qst}

    \begin{chc}
        A. Ecosystem properties change more slowly than individuals in the system.

        B. The stability of an ecosystem tends to change as individuals are replaced.

        C. Individual organisms are stable from one year to the next.

        D. A change in the members of an organism does not affect an ecosystem’s properties.
    \end{chc}

    \begin{psgq}
        An ecologist who studies a pond today may well find it relatively unchanged in a year’s time. Individual fish may be replaced, but the number of fish will tend to be the same from one year to the next. We can say that \textbf{the properties of an ecosystem are more stable than the individual organisms that compose the ecosystem.}
    \end{psgq}

    \begin{nlz}
        A, 本段非常短，迅速看完之后发现最后一句是结论： We can say that the properties of an ecosystem are more stable than the individual organisms that compose the ecosystem.说生态系统比组成生态系统的任意单一物种都稳定，A 是答案。其他三个选项都未提及。
