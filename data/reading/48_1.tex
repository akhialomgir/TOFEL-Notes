        Q13. insert

        Other developments \textbf{addressed the problems of dry and sandy areas unsuitable} for growing China’s native crops.
    \end{qst}

    \begin{psgq}
        This technological advance took many forms: one was the continual introduction from the south of earlier-ripening varieties of rice, which made possible double-cropping (the production of two harvests per year from one field). $\square$ New crops such as corn (maize) and sweet potatoes as well as peanuts and tobacco were introduced from the Americas. $\square$ Corn, for instance, can be grown on the dry soil and marginal hill land of North China, where it is used for food, fuel, and fodder and provides something like one-seventh of the food energy available in the area. $\square$ The sweet potato, growing in sandy soil and providing more food energy per unit of land than other crops, became the main food of the poor in much of the South China rice area. $\square$
