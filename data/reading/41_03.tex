    \begin{qst}
        10. According to paragraph 6, extremely high temperatures increased the amount of carbon dioxide in Venus’ atmosphere by
    \end{qst}

    \begin{chc}
        B. baking out carbon dioxide from carbonate rocks

        D. replacing the previous mechanisms for removing carbon dioxide with less effective ones
    \end{chc}

    \begin{psgq}
        Once Venus’ oceans disappeared, so did the mechanism for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. With no oceans to dissolve it, outgassed carbon dioxide began to accumulate in the atmosphere, intensifying the greenhouse effect even more. \textbf{Temperatures eventually became high enough to “bake out” any carbon dioxide that was trapped in carbonate rocks}\textsubscript{B}. This liberated carbon dioxide formed the thick atmosphere of present-day Venus. Over time, the rising temperatures would have leveled off, solar ultraviolet radiation having broken down atmospheric water vapor molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. With all the water vapor gone, the greenhouse effect would no longer have accelerated.
