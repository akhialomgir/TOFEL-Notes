Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
All scientific discoveries should be shared by the whole world. Governments and businesses should not keep the scientific discoveries secret.
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. Do not use memorized answers.
agree
1. eff: convenient for the scientists. as we all know, current x share, so inconvenient for same work. eg huawei. so inconvenient. -> On the contrary, if share -> x same wk -> save time to do more study.
2. eco: deving countries access to tech -> faciliate the foundation of foundimental equipments -> people life improved

In my point of view, I agree with the point that all scientific discoveries should be shared by the whole world.
To begin with, it will be more convenient for the scientists to do researches. As we all know, nowadays many details of the a variety of researchs remain unknown by the public. So the following scientists should spend a lot of money and time to reach the same consequence. Take metal science as an example, compounds of many useful metals were secrets in the 1900s, and it took scientists lots of work to work it out. On the contrary, if the secrets are shared from now on, it will save the researchers much time to do other studies.
Moreover, it will also faciliate the economy of some developing countries. Since they don't have the money to develop some basic equipments, they are not able to set up some essential infrastrations. However, with the help of the opened studies, it is likely that the lives of the poor people will change totally because of these infrastrations.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
The rapid growth of cities has mostly positive impact on the society.
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. Do not use memorized answers.

disagree
1. harm health.
2. too much competition.

In my point of view, I can't agree with the idea that the rapid growth of the cities has mostly positive effect on the society. Its negative effect sometimes overrun the good impact.

To begin with, the fast growth cause harm to people's health. As we all know, the pollution always complain the cities' construction, especially in the fast contruction. Since the environment do not have time to recover from the culminatation of the exotic chemicals. So people might be exposed to the harmful gases and they are also away from the fresh water. As an result, people's health will be in danger.

Moreover, the fast growth means there is too much competition for the job. The growth of a city needs many works. To accomplish these work, many people are emplyeed. However, when the growth of the city slow down, there won't be such many positions any longer. So many people will lose their jobs. And to maintain their positions, people will take great efforts to work. As an result, the stress on them is quite large to be endure.
